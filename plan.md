# Plan

- [x] Initialize Vite + React 18 project structure
- [x] Configure Vite to build into `app/assets/` with deterministic `index.js` and `index.css` and relative paths
- [x] Add Zendesk `manifest.json`
- [x] Add dev `index.html` that loads ZAF SDK
- [x] Implement React app with ZAF init, data fetching, smart draft, copy/refresh
- [x] Add clean CSS with skeletons and states
- [x] Write README with instructions
- [x] Install dependencies and run production build to generate `app/assets/`
- [ ] Final manual pass for UX polish and error states
